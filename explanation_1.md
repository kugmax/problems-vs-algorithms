## Square Root

The solution is babylon method with `accuracy = 0.0001`

### Time complexity
The second parameter in the returned value shows amount of steps needed to solve it's problem. It grows slowly like 
`O(long(n))`. 

### Space complexity
Amount of space needed to solve problem doesn't depends of `number` and it's constant `O(1)`
